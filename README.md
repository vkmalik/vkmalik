# Hi, I'm Vivek 👋

I’m a Staff Software Engineer focused on building scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly applications. Most of my professional work isn’t reflected here, as it’s either client-specific or part of internal systems, but that doesn’t mean I don’t like to tinker.

This GitHub is my playground for **side projects, experiments, and random coding curiosities** across frontend and backend patterns. These are things I work on when I have some free time-small, self-contained labs to try out new ideas, test patterns, or just see what happens when curiosity meets code.

Feel free to explore, copy, remix, or even break anything here if it helps you learn, experiment, or improve your skills. And if you ever want **different ideas, feedback, or a collaboration partner**, don’t hesitate to reach out, I promise I don’t bite, and I might even offer coffee, virtual high-fives, or unsolicited code jokes.

These projects are a mix of practical experiments, reusable patterns, and occasional “what if I tried this?” moments. Some work, some break spectacularly, and some exist purely to make me question my life choices. Either way, the goal is learning, sharing, and maybe inspiring someone else to try something crazy too.

Enjoy exploring, and feel free to ping me if you want to **discuss, learn, or build something fun together**. Bonus points if you bring snacks or good ideas.
